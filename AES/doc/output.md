FIPS 197 ADVANCED ENCRYPTION STANDARD (AES)
Abstract
In 2000, NIST announced the selection of the Rijndael block cipher family as the winner of the
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) competition. Block ciphers are the foundation for many
cryptographic services, especially those that provide assurance of the confdentiality of data.
Three members of the Rijndael family are specifed in this Standard: AES-128, AES-192, and
AES-256. Each of them transforms data in blocks of 128 bits, and the numerical suffx indicates
the bit length of the associated cryptographic keys.
Keywords: AES; block cipher; confdentiality; cryptography; encryption; Rijndael.

and foreign patents.
11. Export Control. Certain cryptographic devices and technical data regarding them are subject
to federal export controls. Exports of cryptographic modules implementing this Standard and
technical data regarding them must comply with all federal laws and regulations and must
be licensed by the Bureau of Industry and Security of the U.S. Department of Commerce.
Information about export regulations is available at https://www.bis.doc.gov.
12. Qualifcations. NIST will continue to follow developments in the analysis of the AES
algorithm. As with its other cryptographic algorithm standards, NIST will formally reevaluate
this Standard every fve years.
Both this Standard and possible threats reducing the security provided through the use of this
Standard will undergo review by NIST as appropriate, taking into account newly available
analysis and technology. In addition, the awareness of any breakthrough in technology or
any mathematical weakness of the algorithm will cause NIST to reevaluate this Standard and
provide necessary revisions.

FIPS 197 ADVANCED ENCRYPTION STANDARD (AES)
1. Introduction
A block is a sequence of bits of a given fxed length. A block cipher is a family of permutations
of blocks that is parameterized by a sequence of bits called the key.
In 1997, NIST initiated the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) development effort [1] and
called for the public to submit candidate algorithms for block ciphers. Block ciphers are the
foundation for many cryptographic services, especially those that provide assurance of the
confdentiality of data. In 2000, NIST announced the selection of Rijndael [2, 3] for the AES.
This Standard specifes three instantiations of Rijndael: AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256, where
the suffx indicates the bit length of the key. The block size (i.e., the length of the data inputs and
outputs) is 128 bits in each case. Rijndael supports additional block sizes and key lengths that are
not adopted in this Standard.
This Standard is organized as follows:
• Section 2 defnes the terms, acronyms, algorithm parameters, symbols, and functions in
this Standard.
• Section 3 describes the notation and conventions for the ordering and indexing of bits,
bytes, and words.
• Section 4 explains some mathematical components of the AES specifcations: fnite feld
arithmetic and multiplication by a fxed matrix of fnite feld elements.
• Section 5 specifes AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256.
• Section 6 provides implementation guidelines on key length requirements, keying restric-
tions, parameter extensions, and implementation suggestions regarding various platforms.
• Appendix A gives examples of the key expansion routines for AES-128, AES-192, and
AES-256.
• Appendix B gives a step-by-step example of an invocation of AES-128.
• Appendix C gives a reference to the NIST website for extensive example vectors for
AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256.
• Appendix D summarizes the updates to the original version of this publication.

3.  Notation and Conventions
3.1  Inputs and Outputs
A bit isabinarydigit —0or 1. A block is a sequence of 128 bits; the data input and output for
the AES block ciphers are blocks. Another input to the AES block ciphers, called the key, is a bit
sequence that is typically established beforehand and maintained across many invocations of the
block cipher. The lengths of the keys for AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256 are 128 bits, 192 bits,
and 256 bits, respectively.
3.2  Bytes
The basic processing unit in the AES algorithms is the byte — a sequence of eight bits.

|     |     |     |     |     |     | �   |    |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
A byte value is denoted by the concatenation of the eight bits between braces  e.g., {10100011} .
When the bits of a byte are denoted by an indexed variable, the convention in this Standard is for

|     |     |     | �   |     |     |    |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
the indices to decrease from left to right  i.e., {b b b b b b b b } .
|     |     |     |     | 7   | 6  5  4  3  2  1  | 0   |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ----------------- | --- | --- |
It is also convenient to denote byte values using hexadecimal notation.  The 16 hexadecimal
characters represent sequences of four bits, as listed in Table 1. A byte is represented by an
ordered pair of hexadecimal characters, where the left character in the pair represents the four
left-most bits(i.e., b ,b ,b ,b ), and the right character in the pair represents the four right-most

bits (i.e., b ,b ,b ,b ). For example, the hexadecimal form of the byte {10100011} is {a3}.

3.3  Indexing of Byte Sequences
In order to unambiguously represent the data and key inputs as sequences of bytes, the following
indexing convention is adopted in this Standard. Given a sequence of 8k bits,
|     |     | r 0  r 1  | r 2  ... r | r       | r       |     | (3.1)  |
| --- | --- | --------- | ---------- | ------- | ------- | --- | ------ |
|     |     |           | (8k−3)     | (8k−2)  | (8k−1)  |     |        |
(for some positive integer k), the bytes a j  for 0 ≤ j ≤ k − 1 are defned as follows:
|     |     | a = {r | r             | ... r | }.      |     | (3.2)  |
| --- | --- | ------ | ------------- | ----- | ------- | --- | ------ |
|     |     | j      | 8 j  (8 j+1)  |       | (8 j+7) |     |        |
Thus, for example, the data block
|     |     | r   | r r ... r | r         | r    |     |        |
| --- | --- | --- | --------- | --------- | ---- | --- | ------ |
|     |     |     | 0  1  2   | 125  126  | 127  |     | (3.3)  |

As described in Section 3.2, the bits within any individual byte are indexed in decreasing order
from left to right. This ordering is more natural for the fnite feld arithmetic on bytes that is
described in Section 4. The two types of bit indices for byte sequences are illustrated in Table 2.

3.4  The State
Internally, the algorithms for the AES block ciphers are performed on a two-dimensional (four-
by-four) array of bytes called the state. In the state array, denoted by s, each individual byte has
two indices: a row index r in the range 0 ≤ r < 4 and a column index c in the range 0 ≤ c < 4.
| An individual byte of the state is denoted by either s |     |     |     | or s[r,c].  |     |     |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | --- | --- | --- | ----------- | --- | --- |
r,c
In the specifcations for the AES block cipher algorithms in Section 5, the frst step is to copy the
| input array of bytes in | , in , ..., in      | to the state array s as follows:  |                               |     |     |        |
| ----------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | --- | --- | ------ |
|                         | 0 1                 | 15                                |                               |     |     |        |
|                         | s[r,c]= in[r + 4c]  |                                   | for 0 ≤ r < 4 and 0 ≤ c < 4.  |     |     | (3.6)  |
A sequence of transformations is then applied to the state array, after which its fnal value is
| copied to the output array of bytes out |                      | , out | , ..., out                    | as follows:  |     |        |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ----- | ----------------------------- | ------------ | --- | ------ |
|                                         |                      | 0     | 1                             | 15           |     |        |
|                                         | out[r + 4c]= s[r,c]  |       | for 0 ≤ r < 4 and 0 ≤ c < 4.  |              |     | (3.7)  |
The correspondence between the indices of the input and output with the indices of the state array
is illustrated in Fig. 1.

3.5  Arrays of Words
A word is a sequence of four bytes; a block consists of four words. The four columns of state
array s are interpreted as an array v of four words as follows, in the notation of Fig. 1:

|     |     | ⎛ ⎞   |     | ⎛    | ⎞   | ⎛ ⎞   |     | ⎛ ⎞   |     |
| --- | --- | ----- | --- | ---- | --- | ----- | --- | ----- | --- |
|     |     | s     |     | s    |     | s     |     | s     |     |
|     |     | 0,0   |     | 0,1  |     | 0,2   |     | 0,3   |     |
|     |     | ⎜ s ⎟ |     | ⎜ s  | ⎟   | ⎜ s ⎟ |     | ⎜ s ⎟ |     |
v =  1 , 0   ,  v =  1 , 1   ,  v =  1 , 2   ,  v =  1 , 3   .  (3.8)
|     |     | 0  ⎜   ⎟ | 1   | ⎜    | ⎟   | 2  ⎜ ⎟  | 3   | ⎜   ⎟   |     |
| --- | --- | -------- | --- | ---- | --- | ------- | --- | ------- | --- |
|     |     | ⎝ s , ⎠  |     | ⎝ s  | , ⎠ | ⎝ s , ⎠ |     | ⎝ s , ⎠ |     |
|     |     | 2 0      |     | 2    | 1   | 2 2     |     | 2 3     |     |
|     |     | s        |     | s    |     | s       |     | s       |     |
|     |     | 3,0      |     | 3,1  |     | 3,2     |     | 3,3     |     |
Thus, the column index c of s becomes the index for v, and the row index r of s becomes the
index for the four bytes in each word.
Given a one-dimensional array u of words, u[i] denotes the word that is indexed by i, and the
sequence of four words u[i],u[i + 1],u[i + 2],u[i + 3] is denoted by u[i..i + 3].

4.  Mathematical Preliminaries
For some transformations of the AES algorithms specifed in Sec. 5, each byte in the state array
is interpreted as one of the 256 elements of a fnite feld, also known as a Galois Field, denoted
by GF(28). 1
In order to defne addition and multiplication in GF(28), each byte {b
|     |     |     |     |     | b b b       | b b b b } is  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ----------- | ------------- |
|     |     |     |     |     | 7  6  5  4  | 3  2  1  0    |
interpreted as a polynomial, denoted by b(x), as follows:
|     |         | x 7+ b x 6+ b | x 5+ b x 4+ b | x 3+ b x 2+ b |          |        |
| --- | ------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------- | ------ |
|     | b(x)= b |               |               |               | x + b .  | (4.1)  |
|     | 7       | 6             | 5  4          | 3  2          | 1  0     |        |
For example, {01100011} is represented by the polynomial x6 + x5 + x + 1.
4.1  Addition in GF(28)
In order to add two elements in the fnite feld GF(28), the coeffcients of the polynomials that
represent the elements are added modulo 2 (i.e., with the exclusive-OR operation, denoted by ⊕),
so that 1⊕ 1 = 0, 1⊕ 0 = 1, and 0 ⊕ 0 = 0.
Equivalently, two bytes can be added by applying the exclusive-OR operation to each pair of corre-
sponding bits in the bytes. Thus, the sum of {a a a a a a a a } and {b b b b b b b b }
|     |     |     | 7  6  5  | 4  3  2  1  0 | 7  6  5  | 4  3  2  1  0 |
| --- | --- | --- | -------- | ------------- | -------- | ------------- |
is {a ⊕ b a ⊕ b a ⊕ b a ⊕ b a ⊕ b a ⊕ b a ⊕ b a ⊕ b }. (In Section 5.1.4, this
| 7  7  | 6  6  5  | 5  4  4  | 3  3  2  | 2  1  1  0  | 0   |     |
| ----- | -------- | -------- | -------- | ----------- | --- | --- |
defnition is extended to words.)
For example, the following three representations of addition are equivalent:
(x 6+ x 4+ x 2 + x + 1)+(x 7 + x + 1)= x 7+ x 6+ x 4+ x 2 (polynomial)
{01010111}⊕{10000011} = {11010100}
|                   |     |     |     |     | (binary)        | (4.2)  |
| ----------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --------------- | ------ |
| {57}⊕{83} = {d4}  |     |     |     |     | (hexadecimal).  |        |
Because the coeffcients of the polynomials are reduced modulo 2, the coeffcient 1 is equivalent
to the coeffcient –1, so addition is equivalent to subtraction. For example, x4 + x2 represents the
same fnite feld element as x 4 − x2, −x 4 + x 2, and −x 4 − x2. Similarly, the sum of any element
with itself is the zero element.
Multiplication in GF(28)

|                                               |     |     | .  Conceptually, this multiplication is defned  |     |     |     |
on two bytes in two steps: 1) the two polynomials that represent the bytes are multiplied as
polynomials, and 2) the resulting polynomial is reduced modulo the following fxed polynomial:
|     |     | m(x)= x 8+ x 4+ x 3+ x + 1.  |     |     |     | (4.3)  |
| --- | --- | ---------------------------- | --- | --- | --- | ------ |
Within both steps, the individual coeffcients of the polynomials are reduced modulo 2.
1Information about the properties of fnite felds can be found in textbooks, such as Michael Artin’s Algebra [4].

FIPS 197 ADVANCED ENCRYPTION STANDARD (AES)
Thus, if b(x) and c(x) represent bytes b and c, then b • c is represented by the following modular
reduction of their product as polynomials:
b(x)c(x) mod m(x). (4.4)
The modular reduction by m(x) may be applied to intermediate steps in the calculation of b(x)c(x);
consequently, it is useful to consider the special case that c(x)= x (i.e., c = {02}). In particular,
the product b •{02} can be expressed as a function of b, denoted by XTIMES(b), as follows:
(
{b b b b b b b 0} if b = 0
6 5 4 3 2 1 0 7
XTIMES(b)= (4.5)
{b b b b b b b 0}⊕{00011011} if b = 1.
6 5 4 3 2 1 0 7
Multiplication by higher powers of x (such as {04}, {08}, and {10}) can be implemented by the
repeated application of XTIMES(). For example, let b = {57}:
{57}•{01} = {57}
{57}•{02} = XTIMES({57})= {ae}
{57}•{04} = XTIMES({ae})= {47}
{57}•{08} = XTIMES({47})= {8e}
(4.6)
{57}•{10} = XTIMES({8e})= {07}
{57}•{20} = XTIMES({07})= {0e}
{57}•{40} = XTIMES({0e})= {1c}
{57}•{80} = XTIMES({1c})= {38}.
These products facilitate the computation of any multiple of {57}. For example, because {13} =
{10}⊕{02}⊕{01}, it follows that
{57}•{13} = {57}• ({01}⊕{02}⊕{10})
= {57}⊕{ae}⊕{07} (4.7)
= {fe}.
4.3 Multiplication of Words by a Fixed Matrix
Two transformations – MIXCOLUMNS() and INVMIXCOLUMNS() – in the algorithms for the
AES block ciphers can be expressed in terms of matrix multiplication. In particular, a distinct
fxed matrix is specifed for each transformation. For both matrices, each of the 16 entries of the
matrix is a byte of a single specifed word, denoted here by [a ,a ,a ,a ].
0 1 2 3
Given an input word [b ,b ,b ,b ] to the transformation, the output word [d ,d ,d ,d ] is
0 1 2 3 0 1 2 3
determined by fnite feld arithmetic as follows:

4.4  Multiplicative Inverses in GF(28)
For a byte b 6= {00}, its multiplicative inverse is the unique byte, denoted by b−1, such that
|     |     |     | b • b−1 = {01}.  |     |     |     | (4.10)  |
| --- | --- | --- | ---------------- | --- | --- | --- | ------- |
The defnition of the SUBBYTES() transformation in the specifcations of the AES block cipher
involves multiplicative inverses in GF(28), which can be calculated as follows:
b−1 = b254 .
(4.11)
Alternatively, let b(x) be the polynomial that represents b. The extended Euclidean algorithm [5]
can be applied to b(x) and m(x) to fnd polynomials a(x) and c(x) such that
|     |     | b(x)a(x)+ m(x)c(x)= 1.  |     |     |     |     | (4.12)  |
| --- | --- | ----------------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ------- |
It follows that a(x) is the polynomial that represents b−1.

FIPS 197 ADVANCED ENCRYPTION STANDARD (AES)
5. Algorithm Specifcations
The general function for executing AES-128, AES-192, or AES-256 is denoted by CIPHER(); its
inverse is denoted by INVCIPHER().2
The core of the algorithms for CIPHER() and INVCIPHER() is a sequence of fxed transformations
of the state called a round. Each round requires an additional input called the round key; the round
key is a block that is usually represented as a sequence of four words (i.e., 16 bytes).
An expansion routine, denoted by KEYEXPANSION(), takes the block cipher key as input and
generates the round keys as output. In particular, the input to KEYEXPANSION() is represented as
an array of words, denoted by key, and the output is an expanded array of words, denoted by w,
called the key schedule.
The block ciphers AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256 differ in three respects: 1) the length of the
key; 2) the number of rounds, which determines the size of the required key schedule; and 3)
the specifcation of the recursion within KEYEXPANSION(). For each algorithm, the number of
rounds is denoted by Nr, and the number of words of the key is denoted by Nk. (The number of
words in the state is denoted by Nb for Rijndael in general; in this Standard, Nb = 4.) The specifc
values of Nk, Nb, and Nr are given in Table 3. No other confgurations of Rijndael conform to
this Standard.
For implementation issues relating to the key length, block size, and number of rounds, see
Section 6.3.
Table 3. Key-Block-Round Combinations
Key length Block size Number of rounds
Nk (in bits) Nb (in bits) Nr
AES-128 4 128 4 128 10
AES-192 6 192 4 128 12
AES-256 8 256 4 128 14
The three inputs to CIPHER() are: 1) the data input in, which is a block represented as a linear
array of 16 bytes; 2) the number of rounds Nr for the instance; and 3) the round keys. Thus,
AES-128(in,key)= CIPHER(in,10, KEYEXPANSION(key))
AES-192(in,key)= CIPHER(in,12, KEYEXPANSION(key)) (5.1)
AES-256(in,key)= CIPHER(in,14, KEYEXPANSION(key)).
The inverse permutations are defned by replacing CIPHER() with INVCIPHER() in Eq. 5.1.
2Informally, these functions are sometimes called “encryption” and “decryption,” but neutral terminology is appro-
priate because there are other applications of block ciphers besides encryption.
11

FIPS 197 ADVANCED ENCRYPTION STANDARD (AES)
The specifcations of CIPHER(), KEYEXPANSION(), and INVCIPHER() are given in Sections 5.1,
5.2, and 5.3, respectively.
5.1 CIPHER()
The rounds in the specifcation of CIPHER() are composed of the following four byte-oriented
transformations on the state:
• SUBBYTES() applies a substitution table (S-box) to each byte.
• SHIFTROWS() shifts rows of the state array by different offsets.
• MIXCOLUMNS() mixes the data within each column of the state array.
• ADDROUNDKEY() combines a round key with the state.
The four transformations are specifed in Sections 5.1.1–5.1.4. In those specifcations, the
transformed bit, byte, or block is denoted by appending the symbol 0 as a superscript on the
� 0 0 0 0 
original variable i.e., by b, b , s , or s .
i i, j
The round keys for ADDROUNDKEY() are generated by KEYEXPANSION(), which is specifed in
Section 5.2. In particular, the key schedule is represented as an array w of 4 ∗ (Nr + 1) words.
CIPHER() is specifed in the pseudocode in Alg. 1.
Algorithm 1 Pseudocode for CIPHER()
1: procedure CIPHER(in, Nr, w)
2: state ← in . See Sec. 3.4
3: state ← ADDROUNDKEY(state,w[0..3]) . See Sec. 5.1.4
4: for round from 1 to Nr − 1 do
5: state ← SUBBYTES(state) . See Sec. 5.1.1
6: state ← SHIFTROWS(state) . See Sec. 5.1.2
7: state ← MIXCOLUMNS(state) . See Sec. 5.1.3
8: state ← ADDROUNDKEY(state,w[4 ∗ round..4 ∗ round + 3])
9: end for
10: state ← SUBBYTES(state)
11: state ← SHIFTROWS(state)
12: state ← ADDROUNDKEY(state,w[4 ∗ Nr..4 ∗ Nr + 3])
13: return state . See Sec. 3.4
14: end procedure
The frst step (Line 2) is to copy the input into the state array using the conventions from Sec. 3.4.
After an initial round key addition (Line 3), the state array is transformed by Nr applications of
the round function (Lines 4–12); the fnal round (Lines 10–12) differs in that the MIXCOLUMNS()
transformation is omitted. The fnal state is then returned as the output (Line 13), as described in
Section 3.4.

5.1.1  SUBBYTES()
SUBBYTES() is an invertible, non-linear transformation of the state in which a substitution table,
called an S-box, is applied independently to each byte in the state. The AES S-box is denoted by
SBOX().
Let b denote an input byte to SBOX(), and let c denote the constant byte {01100011}. The
0
output byte b = SBOX(b) is constructed by composing the following two transformations:
1. Defne an intermediate value b˜, as follows, where b−1 is the multiplicative inverse of b, as
described in Section 4.4:
|     |     |     | (     |     |             |     |     |     |     |

|     |     |     | {00}  |     | if b = {00} |     |     |     |     |
b˜ =
(5.2)
|     |     |     | b−1  |     | if b =6 | {00}.  |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | ---- | --- | ------- | ------ | --- | --- | --- |
2. Apply the following affne transformation of the bits of b˜ to produce the bits of b 0
:
| b0 = b˜ | ⊕ b˜  |     | ⊕ b˜  |     | ⊕ b˜  |     | ⊕ b˜  |     |     |

5.1.2 SHIFTROWS()
SHIFTROWS() is a transformation of the state in which the bytes in the last three rows of the state
are cyclically shifted. The number of positions by which the bytes are shifted depends on the row
index r, as follows:
s 0 = s for0 ≤ r < 4 and 0 ≤ c < 4. (5.5)
r,c r,(c+r) mod4
SHIFTROWS() is illustrated in Figure 3. In that representation of the state, the effect is to move
each byte by r positions to the left in the row, cycling the left-most r bytes around to the right end
of the row. The frst row, where r = 0, is unchanged.

5.1.3  MIXCOLUMNS()
MIXCOLUMNS() is a transformation of the state that multiplies each of the four columns of the
state by a single fxed matrix, as described in Section 4.3, with its entries taken from the following
word:
|     | [a  | ,a ,a | ,a ]=[{02},{01},{01},{03}].  |     |     |     |     | (5.6)  |

5.1.4 ADDROUNDKEY()
ADDROUNDKEY() is a transformation of the state in which a round key is combined with the
state by applying the bitwise XOR operation. In particular, each round key consists of four words
from the key schedule (described in Section 5.2), each of which is combined with a column of the
state as follows:
[s0 ,s0 ,s0 ,s0 ]=[s ,s ,s ,s ] ⊕ [w ] for 0 ≤ c < 4 (5.9)
0,c 1,c 2,c 3,c 0,c 1,c 2,c 3,c (4∗round+c)
where round is a value in the range 0 ≤ round ≤ Nr, and w[i] is the array of key schedule words
described in Section 5.2. In the specifcation of CIPHER(), ADDROUNDKEY() is invoked Nr + 1
times — once prior to the frst application of the round function (see Alg. 1) and once within each
of the Nr rounds, when 1 ≤ round ≤ Nr.
The action of this transformation is illustrated in Fig. 5, where l = 4 ∗ round. The byte address
within words of the key schedule was described in Sec. 3.5.

FIPS 197  ADVANCED ENCRYPTION STANDARD (AES)
5.2  KEYEXPANSION()
KEYEXPANSION() is a routine that is applied to the key to generate 4 ∗ (Nr + 1) words. Thus,
four words are generated for each of the Nr + 1 applications of ADDROUNDKEY() within the
specifcation of CIPHER(), as described in Section 5.1.4. The output of the routine consists of a
linear array of words, denoted by w[i], where i is in the range 0 ≤ i < 4 ∗ (Nr + 1).
KEYEXPANSION() invokes 10 fxed words denoted by Rcon[ j] for 1 ≤ j ≤ 10. These 10 words
are called the round constants. For AES-128, a distinct round constant is called in the generation
of each of the 10 round keys. For AES-192 and AES-256, the key expansion routine calls the
frst eight and seven of these same constants, respectively. The values of Rcon[ j] are given in
hexadecimal notation in Table 5:
Table 5. Round constants
| j  Rcon[ j]       | j   | Rcon[ j]       |     |     |
| ----------------- | --- | -------------- | --- | --- |
| 1  [01,00,00,00]  | 6   | [20,00,00,00]  |     |     |
| 2  [02,00,00,00]  | 7   | [40,00,00,00]  |     |     |
| [04,00,00,00]     |     | [80,00,00,00]  |     |     |
| 3                 | 8   |                |     |     |
| 4  [08,00,00,00]  | 9   | [1b,00,00,00]  |     |     |
| 5  [10,00,00,00]  | 10  | [36,00,00,00]  |     |     |
The value of the left-most byte of Rcon[ j] in polynomial form is x j−1. Note that for j > 0, these
bytes may be generated by successively applying XTIMES() to the byte represented by xj−1 (see
Eq. 4.5).
Two transformations on words are called within KEYEXPANSION(): ROTWORD() and SUB-
WORD(). Given an input word represented as a sequence [a ,a ,a ,a ] of four bytes,
|     |     | 0 1 | 2 3 |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
ROTWORD([a 0 ,a 1 ,a 2 ,a 3 ]) = [a 1 ,a 2 ,a 3 ,a 0 ],  (5.10)
and
SUBWORD([a ,...,a ]) = [SBOX(a ), SBOX(a ), SBOX(a ), SBOX(a )].  (5.11)
| 0 3 | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
The expansion of the key proceeds according to the pseudocode in Alg. 2. The frst Nk words of
the expanded key are the key itself. Every subsequent word w[i] is generated recursively from the
preceding word, w[i − 1], and the word Nk positions earlier, w[i − Nk], as follows:
• If i is a multiple of Nk, then w[i] = w[i − Nk] ⊕ SUBWORD(ROTWORD(w[i − 1])) ⊕
Rcon[i/Nk].
• For AES-256, if i + 4 is a multiple of 8, then w[i]= w[i − Nk] ⊕ SUBWORD(w[i − 1]).
• For all other cases, w[i]= w[i − Nk] ⊕ w[i − 1].

5.3 INVCIPHER()
To implement INVCIPHER(), the transformations in the specifcation of CIPHER() (Section 5.1)
are inverted and executed in reverse order. The inverted transformations of the state — denoted
by INVSHIFTROWS(), INVSUBBYTES(), INVMIXCOLUMNS(), and ADDROUNDKEY() — are
described in Sections 5.3.1–5.3.4.
INVCIPHER() is described in the pseudocode in Alg. 3, where the array w denotes the key
schedule, as described in Section 5.2.

INVSHIFTROWS() is illustrated in Figure 9. In that representation of the state, the effect is to
move each byte by r positions to the right in the row, cycling the right-most r bytes around to the
left end of the row. The frst row, where r = 0, is unchanged.

5.3.2 INVSUBBYTES()
INVSUBBYTES() is the inverse of SUBBYTES(), in which the inverse of SBOX(), denoted by
INVSBOX(), is applied to each byte of the state. INVSBOX() is derived from Table 4 by switching
the roles of inputs and outputs, as presented in Table 6:

5.3.3  INVMIXCOLUMNS()
INVMIXCOLUMNS() is the inverse of MIXCOLUMNS().  In particular, INVMIXCOLUMNS()
multiplies each of the four columns of the state by a single fxed matrix, as described in Section 4.3,
with its entries taken from the following word:
|     | [a  | ,a ,a | ,a ]=[{0e},{09},{0d},{0b}].  |     |     |     |     | (5.13)  |

Thus,
|     |           |     |        |          |         |                 |     |        |

As a result of this matrix multiplication, the four bytes in a column are replaced by the following:
s 0
|     | =({0e}• s | 0,c | ) ⊕ ({0b}• s | 1,c ) ⊕ ({0d}• s |     | 2,c ) ⊕ ({09}• s | 3,c ) |     |

5.3.4  Inverse of ADDROUNDKEY()
ADDROUNDKEY(), described in Section 5.1.4, is its own inverse.
5.3.5  EQINVCIPHER()
Several properties of the AES algorithm allow for an alternative specifcation of the inverse of
CIPHER(), called the equivalent inverse cipher, denoted by EQINVCIPHER(). In the specifcation
of EQINVCIPHER(), the transformations of the round function of the cipher in Alg. 1 are directly
replaced by their inverses in EQINVCIPHER(), in the same order. The effciency of this structure
in comparison to the specifcation of INVCIPHER() in Alg. 3 is explained in the Rijndael proposal
document [2].
The pseudocode for the equivalent inverse cipher, given in Alg. 4, uses a modifed key schedule,
denoted by the word array dw. The routine to generate dw is an extension of KEYEXPANSION(),
denoted by KEYEXPANSIONEIC(), whose pseudocode is given in Alg. 5.

Algorithm 4 Pseudocode for EQINVCIPHER()
1: procedure EQINVCIPHER(in, Nr, dw)
2: state ← in
3: state ← ADDROUNDKEY(state,dw[4 ∗ Nr..4 ∗ Nr + 3])
4: for round from Nr − 1 downto 1 do
5: state ← INVSUBBYTES(state)
6: state ← INVSHIFTROWS(state)
7: state ← INVMIXCOLUMNS(state)
8: state ← ADDROUNDKEY(state,dw[4 ∗ round..4 ∗ round + 3])
9: end for
10: state ← INVSUBBYTES(state)
11: state ← INVSHIFTROWS(state)
12: state ← ADDROUNDKEY(state,dw[0..3])
13: return state
14: end procedure
Algorithm 5 Pseudocode for KEYEXPANSIONEIC()
1: procedure KEYEXPANSIONEIC(key)
2: i ← 0
3: while i ≤ Nk − 1 do
4: w[i] ← key[4i..4i + 3]
5: dw[i] ← w[i]
6: i ← i + 1
7: end while . When the loop concludes, i = Nk.
8: while i ≤ 4 ∗ Nr + 3 do
9: temp ← w[i − 1]
10: if i mod Nk = 0 then
11: temp ← SUBWORD(ROTWORD(temp)) ⊕ Rcon[i/Nk]
12: else if Nk > 6 and i mod Nk = 4 then
13: temp ← SUBWORD(temp)
14: end if
15: w[i] ← w[i − Nk] ⊕temp
16: dw[i] ← w[i]
17: i ← i + 1
18: end while
19: for round from 1 to Nr − 1 do
20: i ← 4 ∗ round
21: dw[i..i + 3] ← INVMIXCOLUMNS(dw[i..i + 3]) . Note change of type.
22: end for
23: return dw
24: end procedure
The frst and last round keys in dw are the same as in w; the modifcation of the other round keys
is described in Lines 19–22. The comment in Line 21 refers to the input to INVMIXCOLUMNS():
the one-dimensional array of words is converted to a two-dimensional array of bytes, as in Fig. 1.

6. Implementation Considerations
6.1 Key Length Requirements
An implementation of the AES algorithm shall support at least one of the three key lengths
specifed in Sec. 5: 128, 192, or 256 bits (i.e., Nk = 4, 6, or 8, respectively). Implementations
may optionally support two or three key lengths, which may promote the interoperability of
algorithm implementations.
6.2 Keying Restrictions
When a cryptographic key has been generated appropriately (see NIST Special Publication 800-
133, Rev. 2 [6] for guidelines), no restriction is imposed when the resulting key is used for the
AES algorithm.
6.3 Parameter Extensions
In Table 3, this Standard explicitly defnes the allowed values for the key length (Nk), block
size (Nb), and number of rounds (Nr). However, future revisions of this Standard could include
changes or additions to the allowed values for those parameters. Therefore, implementers may
choose to design their AES implementations with future fexibility in mind.
6.4 Implementation Suggestions Regarding Various Platforms
Implementation variations are possible that may, in many cases, offer performance or other
advantages. Given the same input key and data (plaintext or ciphertext), any implementation that
produces the same output (ciphertext or plaintext) as the algorithm specifed in this Standard is an
equivalent implementation of the AES algorithm.
The AES proposal document [2] and other resources located on the AES page [7] include
suggestions on how to effciently implement the AES algorithm on a variety of platforms.
Suggested implementations are intended to explain the inner workings of the AES algorithm but
do not provide protection against various implementation attacks.
A physical implementation may leak key-dependent information through side channels, such
as the time taken to perform a computation, or when faults are injected into the computation.
When such attacks are non-invasive, they can be effective even when there are mechanisms to
detect physical tampering of the device. For example, cache-timing attacks may affect AES
implementations on software platforms that use a cache to accelerate the access to data from main
memory.
Protecting implementations of the AES algorithm against implementation attacks where applicable
should be considered. Such considerations are outside of the scope of this document but are taken
into account when testing for conformance to the algorithm in this Standard according to the
validation program developed by NIST (see https://nist.gov/cmvp).

6.5 Modes of Operation
Block cipher modes of operation are cryptographic functions that feature a block cipher to provide
information services, such as confdentiality and authentication. NIST-recommended modes of
operation are specifed in the 800-38 series of NIST Special Publications. Further information is
available at https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/block-cipher-techniques/BCM.

Appendix A — Key Expansion Examples
This appendix shows the development of the key schedule for each key size. Note that multi-byte
values are presented using the notation described in Sec. 3. The intermediate values produced
during the development of the key schedule (see Sec. 5.2) are given in the following table (all
values are in hexadecimal format with the exception of the index column (i)).

FIPS 197 ADVANCED ENCRYPTION STANDARD (AES)
Appendix C — Example Vectors
The NIST Computer Security Resource Center provides a website with “examples with interme-
diate values” for AES [8].

FIPS 197 ADVANCED ENCRYPTION STANDARD (AES)
Appendix D — Change Log (Informative)
The original FIPS 197 (November 26, 2001) was reviewed and updated under the auspices of
NIST’s Crypto Publication Review Board [9]. Public comments and analyses of the security of
the AES that are described in NIST IR 8319 [10] were the basis for the decision to maintain the
technical specifcations of the Standard.
The following is a summary of the editorial changes to the original FIPS 197 in the May 9, 2023
update, NIST FIPS 197-upd1:
1. The formatting of many elements of the publication was improved, and the text was revised
for clarity.
2. The following items were added to the front matter: title page, foreword, abstract, and
keywords. Offcials’ names and affliations on the title page refect the original publication.
3. The announcement sections were updated to refect current statutes, regulations, standards,
guidelines, and validation programs.
4. Section 1 was revised to 1) add and update references to the AES development effort and 2)
explicitly name AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256.
5. The material in the previous Section 2.2 (Algorithm Parameters, Symbols and Functions)
was split into two new sections: 2.2 (List of Functions) and 2.3 (Algorithm Parameters and
Symbols).
6. The terms, functions, and symbols from the specifcations are comprehensively included in
the lists in Sections 2.1–2.3.
7. The description of the indexing convention was removed from Section 3.1.
8. Table 1 was revised, and the text in the previous Section 3.2 on the polynomial interpretation
of bytes was revised and moved to Section 4.
9. A general defnition of the indexing of byte sequences was added to Section 3.3 before
specializing to the example of a block, and Table 2 was revised.
10. The heading for Section 3.5 was changed to focus on word arrays, and notation for them
was included in the text. The column words of the state were presented in a vertical format,
with an improved description of the indices.
11. A reference for additional information on fnite felds [4] was included in a footnote within
Section 4, and the headings for Sections 4.1 and 4.2 were revised to explicitly mention
GF(28).
12. Section 4.2 was revised to provide an explicit, general description of fnite feld multiplica-
tion. The previous Section 4.2.1 was incorporated into the revised Section 4.2 by replacing
the original example of modular polynomial reduction with an illustration of fnite feld
multiplication using xtime.
13. The heading of Section 4.3 was revised to focus on multiplication by a fxed matrix, and the
text of the section was simplifed by removing the secondary interpretation as polynomial

FIPS 197 ADVANCED ENCRYPTION STANDARD (AES)
reduction. The descriptions of MIXCOLUMNS() and INVMIXCOLUMNS() in Sections 5.1.3
and 5.3.3 were revised accordingly, to refer back to this construction.
14. The text on multiplicative inverses in GF(28) from the previous Section 4.2 was revised
and moved to the new Section 4.4.
15. The discussion of the algorithm specifcations in Section 5 was expanded to elaborate on the
relationships among its components. A new brief explanation of Nb as a Rijndael parameter
enabled the replacement of Nb with its constant value 4 in the rest of the Standard.
16. The pseudocode for the cipher, the key expansion routine, and the inverse cipher in Sections
5.1, 5.2, and 5.3 was reformatted, and some of the text in these sections was revised for
clarity.
17. The descriptions of SHIFTROWS() in Section 5.1.2 and INVSHIFTROWS() in Section 5.3.2
were improved, and a mistake in the latter was corrected.
18. Illustrations of the three instances of KEYEXPANSION() in the new Figs. 6, 7, and 8 were
added to Section 5.2. The text in the section was also revised, including an explicit display
of the round constants in the new Fig. 5.
19. A separate algorithm for the modifed key expansion routine for the equivalent inverse
cipher was added to Section 5.3.5 instead of only the supplementary lines. The description
of the equivalent inverse cipher was simplifed in favor of the citation of an updated
reference [3].
20. Section 6.2 was revised to include a reference to NIST Special Publication 800-133,
Rev. 2 [6].
21. Section 6.4 was revised to expand the discussion of implementation attacks.
22. The References section is no longer labeled as an appendix. The references were updated
to replace withdrawn publications and correct citation information and URLs.
23. The examples in Appendix C were removed in favor of a reference to the detailed example
vectors that are now maintained at [8].
24. Appendix D was created to summarize the changes in this update to FIPS 197.
